Meet your next read!

Book Hunt is an application designed with avid readers in mind, it provides the user/reader with a number of choices to find the prefect book from the comfort of their own homes.
The user will automatically see five current Best Sellers from the New York Times Best Sellers list.
The user is able to search for a desired book by title or by author.
When the user makes a choice based on their search, the user is provided information about the book (Book Name, Author Name, Book Synopsis, Rating and redirects user to Amazon for buying options).
The user can then save desired book/books to their own wishlist for later access.
